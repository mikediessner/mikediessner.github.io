# Tutorial: Create a personal website with Quarto

## Step 1: Fork this GitHub repository

## Step 2: Install Quarto

The website is rendered with Quarto. You can download Quarto from [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## Step 3: Update ``_quarto.yml``

In the website section, update title with your name, i.e. "FirstName SirName".
I chose to display the navigation bar (social media links, etc.) on the top
right and let it feature links to my GitHub, Google Scholar, Twitter, LinkedIn, 
and e-mail.

## Step 4: Update ``index.qmd``

## Step 5: Upload profile picture and favicon

Swap ``profile.jpg`` with one of your high quality pictures. If you choose a 
different name, make sure to also update the name in the About section in the
``index.qmd``.

By default the favicon (your website's icon in your browser) is a :laptop:. You
can create you own favicon and substitute it for ``favicon.png``. I made the
favicon with [favicon.io](https://favicon.io), a free service that does not
require an account. If you choose a different name or file extension, make sure
to also update the name in the website section in the ``_quarto.yml``. 

## Step 6: Push to remote repository

## Step 7: Enable GitHub Pages
