My research focuses on developing methods at the interface of inference and machine learning, oriented towards problems in statistical genetics and sports analytics.\nI previously received my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University under supervision of Professor Kathryn Roeder and Max G’Sell. My thesis work focused on selective inference approaches for augmenting genetic association studies with data-guided hypothesis testing.\nI also actively publish research on statistics in sports, and have developed multiple R packages to enable easy access of publicly available data. Additionally, Rebecca Nugent, Sam Ventura, and I co-organize the annual Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference which promotes the latest sports analytics research and features a reproducible research competition.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nStatistics in Sports\nStatistical Genetics\nSelective Inference\nClustering\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\nPhD in Statistics\nAdvisors: Kathryn Roeder and Max G’Sell\n\n\nPittsburgh, PA\nGranted May 2022\n\n\n\nDissertation: Selective inference approaches for augmenting genetic association studies with multi-omics metadata\n\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\nBS in Statistics with University Honors\n\n\nPittsburgh, PA\nGranted Dec 2015"
