## :wave: About
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](profile.jpg)

I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Computing at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) in the United Kingdom. Within the university, I am part of the [Cloud Computing for Big Data CDT](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/) and the [Fluid Dynamics Lab](https://www.experimental-fluid-dynamics.com). \
\
My research focuses on **computer emulators** and the optimisation of physical experiments and computer simulators. I am also developing `NUBO`, a transparent **Bayesian optimisation** package in Python, with the aim of making the optimisation of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions accessible to researchers from all disciplines. An open-source version is available [here](https://mikediessner.github.io/nubo).

## :bulb: Teaching

I worked as a teaching assistant on the following courses:  

 - **Computing Foundations of Data Science**: Postgraduate-level module teaching the fundamentals of programming in *Python*.  

 - **Data Management and Exploratory Data Analysis**: Postgraduate-level module teaching students all necessary tools to analyse data with *R*.  

 - **Statistics for Empirical Psychology**: Undergraduate-level module teaching the fundamentals of statistics to psychology students (linear regression, mixed-effects model, hypothesis testing, etc.).
