![](profile.jpg)

I am a second-year PhD student in Computing at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) in the United Kingdom. Within the university, I am part of the [Cloud Computing for Big Data CDT](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/) and the [Fluid Dynamics Lab](https://www.experimental-fluid-dynamics.com). \
\
My research focuses on computer emulators and optimisation of physical experiments and computer simulations.

## Teaching

I worked as a teaching assistant on the following courses:  

**Computing Foundations of Data Science**  
Postgraduate-level module teaching the fundamentals of programming in *Python*.  

**Data Management and Exploratory Data Analysis**  
Postgraduate-level module teaching students all necessary tools to analyse data with *R*.  

**Statistics for Empirical Psychology**  
Undergraduate-level module teaching fundamental statistics to psychology students (linear regression, mixed-effects model, hypothesis testing, etc.).
